This container derives from
[vcatechnology/centos-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/centos-ci) so that the
image has the latest [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) packages. It then
installs the some useful packages for building projects with the
[VCA Tool Chain](https://gitlab.vcatechnology.com/tool-chain/tool-chain).

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/centos-toolchain](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/centos-toolchain/)
